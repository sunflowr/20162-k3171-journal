				Yesterday was the presentation. We meet up an hour before to sync and it was discovered that there was some issues in the prototype. Apparently something had changed in the data that we hadn&rsquo;t taken into consideration (a registered device without any discovered devices). After fixing this we had a small sync and some coffee. After that it was time for presentation. Presentation While it seemed hard to understand our concept at first, I felt that the audience grasped somewhat in the end what we tried to explore.

				What was done yesterday. We added a new background again to see if this could take us in the direction we wanted to go with the experience. To some extent it felt closer to the initial idea. After the rewriting of rendering to use DOM/CSS instead of JS canvas there were further enhancements made today so the object resize as the background is &ldquo;zoomed&rdquo;, thus creating a feeling of depth. Issues After trying with real data from the teachers firebase account it became clear that there might be some performance issues when rendering on a phone.

				What happened yesterday: Up until now we have tried to use the canvas objec together with javascript in order to draw the devices. During the day an idea to use CSS instead was formed and was later concived. The result so far looks promising and so far seem to help make the code a bit cleaner and easier to maintain. The code used to fake found bt devices have also been updated, modularized and moved to it&rsquo;s own javascript file (btdevice.js).

				Today I worked some on the coding, try to get a simple version of the idea up and running using HTML5 Canvas and Javascript. Currently there&rsquo;s some issues with scaling making things look aliased. It&rsquo;s currently using manually added fake data from firebase as input. The idea thus far seem to be that a listening device is represented as a &lsquo;circle&rsquo;. The size of this &lsquo;circle&rsquo; is determined by the amount of found devices.

				Project Description from Fredrik In the 2D-illustration the space is created between the objects ”balls”. However the idea of the balls are dependent on the viewers perspective and relation to its surrounding. If you don’t have any relation to a object you will compare it to similar objects. The balls can be viewed upon two ways. That the balls are the same size and they will seam to be more or less distant from the viewers point of view.

				Ideas Avoidance game. BT others is to be avoided. Alien radar thing Blindfold - audio/rumble feedback The more devices the higher amplitude/frequency. Space representation. Notes: Task: Bluetooth - explore Distance Obstruction Get a feeling for material Sound: Molecule movement =&gt; virbrations =&gt; sound Difference IR vs BT: Bluetooth: shorter wavelength =&gt; Through walls, bend Infrared: directional =&gt; Can&rsquo;t go through walls. Questions: Where can I find bluetooth? How much bluetooth devices is there in location X?

				Fridays work: Material for creating an spatial experience Read the sources below and continue to explore how this can help you create a spatial experience. Perhaps a productive way to think about the material when you read it is to relate it to coupling (Time, Location, Direction, Dynamics, Modality, and Expression). In that way you will perhaps get a feeling for what kind of experiences Bluetooth can resonate with more easily.

Pick a non-digital tool and attempt to identify its six aspects of coupling. Try the same with an app or physical product with digital interactivity How do you think this work is useful for the designer?

				Interactivity OR:B441 Reading 1: Lenz et al Write down concrete examples for each axis of the 11 dimensions (22 examples in total then) Can you sketch alternatives? Eg design an alternative to a stepwise interaction that makes it fluent interaction Note: Unfortunatelly I was sick this day so had to prepare from home.

				Introductions OR:B441 Reading 1: Schön - Design as Reflective Conversation with the Materials of the Design Situation How does Schön describe the design knowledge? Can you think of other examples of &lsquo;knowing-in-action&rsquo; from your every day life? For Schön, what form does a &lsquo;design situation&rsquo; take, and how do we grasp it? Briefly describe Schön&rsquo;s account of seeing/moving/seeing How do you think this process relates to sketching with digital materials, such as code?
