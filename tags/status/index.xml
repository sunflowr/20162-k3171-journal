      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Through most of the day we experimented with applying different effects (volume, panning, filter, delay, reverb, &amp;hellip;) to the sounds and changing different parameters using the X and Y accelerometer sensors and the potentiometer. We discovered that it was hard to noticed if the user was changing the sounds or if the sounds where changing them self. The sounds included very dynamic elements and were already very highly processed with reverb, delays and filters that it was hard to apply anything like this and change the sound subtly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been much better if we were allowed to use raw unprocessed waveforms or the sound devices included in Ableton. It would have allowed for more changes. Take a square-wave, we could have mapped sensors to pulse-width and pitch and create lots of changes in the sound without even using filters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sketching-z-axis&#34;&gt;Sketching Z-axis&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had previously wondered about the third axis - the Z axis - as there were pin-header for connecting it to the Arduino. Today we discovered that actually there were solder holes for soldering in wires to 5V, GND, X,Y and Z. Apparently we had to solder a wire to access the Z-reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was kind of funny because the Z-axis actually behaved more like we expected a accelerometer to behave. Always striving for a value and when affected with movement jump in the values but as soon as it was still go back towards this middle-value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After fixing this we started trying out the Z-axis applying a frequency-shifting effect when force were applied to Z. This turned out to work so satisfyingly well that we held on to that functionality for the rest of the day. The feedback felt so &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; and expected in the way the sound went up and down in pitch with the up and down movement of the chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We felt a certain tightness to the interaction and how it behaved, it always seemed to behave the same way and it was easy to understand. But thanks to gravity and precision in motor skills it&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel you have a exact control of it. One of the teaches suggested it made it more ambiguous than tight. As I see tightness as being the about the experienced tightness between the interaction and the feedback from the system and the user understanding the correlation. The more clear this is to the user, the tighter the interaction feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The prevailing buttons in Snoezlen mostly react &lt;em&gt;instantaneously&lt;/em&gt;; that is, cause and effect happen (almost) at the same time, but the buttons separate cause and effect with regards to location and amount of feedback. [&amp;hellip;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attributes of tightness play out differently across the designs. Both &lt;em&gt;MalleablePillow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ActiveCurtain&lt;/em&gt; give feedback instantaneously where they are touched, and they react proportionally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Larsen, 2015)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ambiguousness is about a lack of understanding of how something work, causing the user to guess and in best of cases explore to get a better (deeper) understanding of the feedback from the interaction/artifact/system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;By impelling people to interpret situations for themselves, it encourages them to start grappling conceptually with systems and their contexts, and thus to establish deeper and more personal relations with meanings offered by the system&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Gaver, Beaver, &amp;amp; Benford, 2003)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d argue that the two don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to be in odd to each other in this case. The user can experience a direct result of sitting on the chair - tightness:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing of a sound and hearing it change in pitch with the movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s still the question if the user instantly realize that moving up and down changes the pitch of the sound or if this is something that will be realized through exploration - ambiguity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we fixed with the chair. The idea was to use a typical office chair unfortunately it turns out it was hard to attach the potentiometer to them. After looking around for different solutions to this and talking to the people in the workshop area we found some chairs that we were able to pull apart easier to attach the potentiometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to fix the potentiometer to the chair we pulled it apart and took a wooden block and attached it to the chair and drilled a hole for the potentiometer to sit in (see attached photos).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a few ideas on how to the actual connection between the turning part of the chair and the potentiometer. But most of them required much work to get it working. In the end we realized we could just do it similar to how old belt-driven record players work. So we put a elastic around the rotating part and the potentiometer and rely on friction to turn the knob. It seemed to work really well so we went with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly realized it was better to attach the accelerometer to the chair instead of the user. It fixed issues regarding how the user would have been limited in the movement by the wires attached to the accelerometer. In this way it also put the focus all on the chair and allowed for more flowing openness for the users. The user now just had to sit down without first having to attach some device before using the artifact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this we finally felt ready to start sketching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sketching&#34;&gt;Sketching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of todays sketches was about getting to know the sensors and what we can expect from them and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We played around with X and Y axis mostly as we found them very confusing. We expected them to be continuously changing with the movement (or lack of movement). But instead it seemed to give us something that looked more like absolute values that you would expect from a gyroscope. We did lots of tests and felt that this behaviour seemed to happen each time so we decided on using it in this more &amp;ldquo;gyroscopic&amp;rdquo; way, using the values to measure how far the user were leaning in a direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;photos&#34;&gt;Photos&lt;/h3&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This day I unfortunately had to work from home so only had contact with the other group member through chat. We decided on trying out things on our own and see what we could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I went and bought the accelerometer the day before I thought I try it out today and see how it behaves. I connected it up to the Arduino and tried it out in Max for Live, connecting it to a few parameters and tried moving it around. It seemed to work fine and it looked like we could work with the values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thought it felt clear that it was important to try it with the correct chair as soon as possible as the way I move it with my hand is much different from the movement you make when re-positioning and leaning on a chair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accelerometer sensor used:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sunflowr.github.io/20162-k3171-journal/20162-k3171-journal/img/20161019/accelerometer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Accelerometer sensor&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ideas&#34;&gt;Ideas&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Platform - mobile phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use touch gesture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use pixels as indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;force-touch-hold-to-call-favorite&#34;&gt;Force-touch - hold to call favorite&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When user force touch over a certain threshold on the Phone icon the user is given the option to call a favorite contact without having to go through the contact book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;multi-touch-swipe-skip-x-pages&#34;&gt;Multi-touch swipe - skip X pages&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on amount of fingers touching the screen when swiping skip X amount of pages. E.g. when flicking through the app pages, instead of swiping three times to go from page 1 to page 3, swipe with two fingers to jump forward two pages instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;swipe-gesture-on-the-home-button&#34;&gt;Swipe gesture on the &amp;ldquo;Home button&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considering that the &amp;ldquo;home button&amp;rdquo; now day seem to be smarter than just a regular button (e.g. finger recognition) we wondered if it would be possible to some how detect gestures on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could interacting using gestures on this button rather than the screen aid in everyday actions on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;interactive-billboards&#34;&gt;Interactive billboards&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would happen if public billboards were more like gigantic interactive screens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How would it handle multiple users?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it make people take more notice to and engage more in the message on the billboard (e.g. even if it were a commercial for toothbrushes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;pinching-for-overview&#34;&gt;Pinching for overview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to how it&amp;rsquo;s used on OSX give the user a overview screen of all the active applications; doing this on the phone could as an example present the available pages on the home screen of the phone for faster movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;misc-ideas&#34;&gt;Misc ideas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there any reason for not interacting using the foot more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;selected-idea-fast-scroll-filter-scroll&#34;&gt;Selected idea - Fast scroll / filter scroll.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a bit more discussions and consulting with the teacher we ended up with a combination of some ideas that we evolved into our current idea.
We aim to create something that could be used in context of social media, news site and other sites that are based on articles/posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow the user to do fast scroll / filter scroll to quickly skip articles in the article feed based on some search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this we split the screen into multiple areas. One area functions like normal and allow the user to scroll normally, the other area(s) act as zones that react on swipe up/down and react by searching for next/previous post using the selected search criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to allow the user to for example skip posts in social media to jump to next post for a certain friend, page or group without having to scroll forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some extra ideas with using force-touch to scroll within post comments that we&amp;rsquo;re considering trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sunflowr.github.io/20162-k3171-journal/20162-k3171-journal/img/20161005/sketch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sketch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;rsquo;ve worked some more on the prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We attached the sensors and vibrators to the two cloth-pieces. (see attached image)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added communication code using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire&#34;&gt;Wire Library&lt;/a&gt; for communication between the two Arduino devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fixed battery adaptors for the Arduinos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sunflowr.github.io/20162-k3171-journal/20162-k3171-journal/img/20160928/svsketch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;sensor and vibrator sketch&#34; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes&#34;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social akwardness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive/negative feelings subjective - e.g. rollercoaster&amp;rsquo;s amount of scary-fun depends on the user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self sacrifice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control frame - give user more control (more control good/bad? more control of other good/bad?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive: Breaking ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative: Making yourself center of attention / making fool of yoursef.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues&#34;&gt;Issues:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having on Arduino power both of the devices seemed to draw too much current so we decided on using batteries for each device - this should hopefully fix the issue as it&amp;rsquo;s been tested before that one Arduino indeed can power all five vibrators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been having issues with the lab wires send with the Arduinos - they seem to either be broken from beginning or breaking too easy. We&amp;rsquo;ve had to replace a few.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resolved&#34;&gt;Resolved:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seems the touch will be fine siting on the clothes as far as we&amp;rsquo;ve tested. No false positives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got some stuff done today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build the vibrator and touch circuits (see attached images)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made the cloth-pieces (see attached images)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues-thoughts&#34;&gt;Issues / thoughts:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be any issue with false positives on the touch if the clothes are sitting too close to the skin of the user? Need to be tested!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;resolved&#34;&gt;Resolved:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Arduino seem to be able to power all five vibrators without any problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototyped the vibration and touch circuits to see if it would work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to use capacitive touches and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor&#34;&gt;Capacitive Sensing Library&lt;/a&gt; for Arduino to handle this.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Was feeling a bit better today so we meet up to talk about the project and do some initial plan for how we were going to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided on going with &amp;ldquo;Social Awkwardness&amp;rdquo;. Being in a environment when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what to talk about or how to get some connection to the other people there. Designing something to break the ice through self-sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a bit of brain storming and came up with a few ideas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the presentation. We meet up an hour before to sync and it was discovered that there was some issues in the prototype. Apparently something had changed in the data that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken into consideration (a registered device without any discovered devices). After fixing this we had a small sync and some coffee. After that it was time for presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seemed hard to understand our concept at first, I felt that the audience grasped somewhat in the end what we tried to explore. I guess that we had not found a good way of describing our prototype or the findings. Our concept was a bit abstract and on a meta level where we were more focusing on the idea of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some critique on the concepts use of bluetooth which I can in hindsight understand, as we focused more on exploring space and how things are interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-to-consider-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Things to consider for the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we present the findings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-was-done-yesterday&#34;&gt;What was done yesterday.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We added a new background again to see if this could take us in the direction we wanted to go with the experience. To some extent it felt closer to the initial idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rewriting of rendering to use DOM/CSS instead of JS canvas there were further enhancements made today so the object resize as the background is &amp;ldquo;zoomed&amp;rdquo;, thus creating a feeling of depth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;issues&#34;&gt;Issues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying with real data from the teachers firebase account it became clear that there might be some performance issues when rendering on a phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done some small optimization but nothing that gives that needed boost.. the best option so far is to put a cap on amount of found devices to render.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-was-done-today&#34;&gt;What was done today&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;result-so-far&#34;&gt;Result so far:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2D vs 3D space:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://sunflowr.github.io/20162-k3171-journal/20162-k3171-journal/img/20160915/2d.png&#34; alt=&#34;2D space&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://sunflowr.github.io/20162-k3171-journal/20162-k3171-journal/img/20160915/3d.png&#34; alt=&#34;3D space&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-status&#34;&gt;Current status&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still a bit slow on mobile unfortunatelly, but good enough for demonstation I guess. We changed from infite animation to active on click/tap. When user interact we either go from 2D to 3D or 3D to 2D depending on current state.&lt;/p&gt;
