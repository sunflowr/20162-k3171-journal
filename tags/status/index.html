				Today we&rsquo;ve worked some more on the prototype. We attached the sensors and vibrators to the two cloth-pieces. Added communication code using the Wire Library for communication between the two Arduino devices. Fixed battery adaptors for the Arduinos. Notes Social akwardness Positive/negative feelings subjective - e.g. rollercoaster&rsquo;s amount of scary-fun depends on the user. Self sacrifice Control frame - give user more control (more control good/bad? more control of other good/bad?) Positive: Breaking ice Negative: Making yourself center of attention / making fool of yoursef.

				Got some stuff done today: Build the vibrator and touch circuits (see attached images) Made the cloth-pieces (see attached images) Issues / thoughts: Will there be any issue with false positives on the touch if the clothes are sitting too close to the skin of the user? Need to be tested! Resolved: The Arduino seem to be able to power all five vibrators without any problem.

				Today&rsquo;s work: Prototyped the vibration and touch circuits to see if it would work. We&rsquo;re going to use capacitive touches and the Capacitive Sensing Library for Arduino to handle this. Notes What is socially unacceptable dancing? Acceptable/unacceptable dance roles/moves/behaviours? Reasoning of concept Social awkwardness + akwardness = hapiness (?) Being with people without having anything to talk about Target group Make the idea clear Make it really negative - push it more Issues / thoughts: Will the Arduino be able to power all the five vibrators at the same time?

				Today we mostly gathered the needed material - such as fabric and electronic hardware. Also did some research on how to implement the touch.

				Was feeling a bit better today so we meet up to talk about the project and do some initial plan for how we were going to work. We decided on going with &ldquo;Social Awkwardness&rdquo;. Being in a environment when you don&rsquo;t know what to talk about or how to get some connection to the other people there. Designing something to break the ice through self-sacrifice. We had a bit of brain storming and came up with a few ideas: Go away jeans - detect when offender try to touch users ass and react to it Clapping glove - a glove that creates a synthesized clapping sound when user claps to exaggerate the clapping.

				Yesterday was the presentation. We meet up an hour before to sync and it was discovered that there was some issues in the prototype. Apparently something had changed in the data that we hadn&rsquo;t taken into consideration (a registered device without any discovered devices). After fixing this we had a small sync and some coffee. After that it was time for presentation. Presentation While it seemed hard to understand our concept at first, I felt that the audience grasped somewhat in the end what we tried to explore.

				What was done yesterday. We added a new background again to see if this could take us in the direction we wanted to go with the experience. To some extent it felt closer to the initial idea. After the rewriting of rendering to use DOM/CSS instead of JS canvas there were further enhancements made today so the object resize as the background is &ldquo;zoomed&rdquo;, thus creating a feeling of depth. Issues After trying with real data from the teachers firebase account it became clear that there might be some performance issues when rendering on a phone.
