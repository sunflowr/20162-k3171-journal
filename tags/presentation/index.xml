&lt;p&gt;We meet up in the morning to test so everything worked, of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One important wire was broken and needed replacement and one vibrator wire needed to be re-attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we confirmed everything as working we went to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bit nervous the presentation went fine. They seemed to think it was an interesting concept. Nothing really negative to say about it. They suggested taking a step back from our context and see in what other areas/context the idea could be used - to explore outside the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seemed to like the idea of giving one of the user all the control (touch) while the other loosing the control (user with vibrator) having to rely on the other user.&lt;/p&gt;
