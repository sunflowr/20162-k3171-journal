&lt;p&gt;We meet up in the morning to test so everything worked, of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t.
One important wire was broken and needed replacement and one vibrator wire needed to be re-attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we confirmed everything as working we went to the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a bit nervous the presentation went fine. They seemed to think it was an interesting concept. Nothing really negative to say about it. They suggested taking a step back from our context and see in what other areas/context the idea could be used - to explore outside the context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They seemed to like the idea of giving one of the user all the control (touch) while the other loosing the control (user with vibrator) having to rely on the other user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;end-result&#34;&gt;End result&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was the presentation. We meet up an hour before to sync and it was discovered that there was some issues in the prototype. Apparently something had changed in the data that we hadn&amp;rsquo;t taken into consideration (a registered device without any discovered devices). After fixing this we had a small sync and some coffee. After that it was time for presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;Presentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it seemed hard to understand our concept at first, I felt that the audience grasped somewhat in the end what we tried to explore. I guess that we had not found a good way of describing our prototype or the findings. Our concept was a bit abstract and on a meta level where we were more focusing on the idea of space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some critique on the concepts use of bluetooth which I can in hindsight understand, as we focused more on exploring space and how things are interpreted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-to-consider-for-the-future&#34;&gt;Things to consider for the future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we present the findings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/h3&gt;
